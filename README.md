# [React YardSale](https://react-yardsale-six.vercel.app/)
You might have seen my other project [YardSale-Design](https://github.com/EA-Gadgeter/YardSale-Design), basically this project its the 
evolution of that one, but this time I make it with React.
This project is the result of the [React.js Practical Course](https://platzi.com/cursos/react-practico/), by Platzi.

## Features
- The app its mobile optimized, or at least it should be, feel free to check it.
- The cart its fully functional, you can add and remove products from it.
- The previous version had harcoded products, this time they come from the [Platzi Fake Store API](https://fakeapi.platzi.com/), 
  so thanks to Platzi for it.
